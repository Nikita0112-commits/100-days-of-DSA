Time Complexity: O(N1+N2), where N1 is the number of nodes in the first linked list and N2 is nodes in the second linked list. We traverse both linked lists in a single pass for merging without any additional loops or nested iterations.
Space Complexity: O(1), no additonal space is used to store the elements.
